I am a Phd Student at [ENS Paris](<https://www.computationalculturalsciences.com/charles-de-dampierre>) & a Research Engineer at [SciencePo Medialab](<https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/en/people/charles-de-dampierre/>). I am mostly interested in understanding how Social Media and the Internet work and how we can use algorithm sto explore the web more meaningfully and more efficiently while reducing biais and leveraging Collective Intelligence.

I am specialist in Natural Language Processing and Networks. I have a background in Business, in Cognitive Science & in Social Science.

I created [Bunka](https://www.bunka.ai/) an Exploration Engine which goal is to aggregate and summarise information on the web and display it in new innovative way.

You can find my blog here and my publications here (/al-folio/publications/). You can contact me any time, I am always happy to discuss new ideas.
