I am a Phd Student at [ENS Paris](<https://www.computationalculturalsciences.com/charles-de-dampierre>) in Computational Social Science & a former Research Engineer at [SciencePo Medialab](<https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/en/people/charles-de-dampierre/>). I am mostly interested in understanding how LLMs are trained and what data are used to do so. I have a background in Business, Cognitive Science & Social Science. Some of my work is also about quantitative history and the different methods to estimate standards of livings in the past.

I created [Bunka](https://www.bunka.ai/) an Exploration Engine which goal is to better visualise and explore the trainign datasets of AI.
