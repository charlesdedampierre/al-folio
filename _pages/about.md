I am the CEO of [Bunka](https://www.bunka.ai/), a company dedicated to enhancing the value of your existing data by creating a visual interface that allows you to clearly see everything you have, identify patterns and outliers, and navigate the era of massive-scale data.

I hold a PhD in Computational Social Science from  [ENS Paris](<https://www.computationalculturalsciences.com/charles-de-dampierre>) and I am a former Research Engineer at [SciencePo Medialab](<https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/en/people/charles-de-dampierre/>). I am primarily interested in understanding how to identify trends and patterns in large-scale datasets.

Prior to the PhD, I completed a master's in Cognitive Science at ENS Paris and a Master's in Business Administration at HEC Paris.

Some of my work also involves quantitative history and various methods to estimate standards of living in the past.
